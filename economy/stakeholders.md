![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

To ensure the success of the platform ecosystem and **GGEZ1** project token, the generated revenues must accrue value to all stakeholders involved with the project; therefore, the generated revenues will be distributed across the following three stakeholders:

1\. **GGEZ1 Foundation:** To support the foundation DAO and Community and pay dividends to GGEZ1 token holders.

2\. **GGEZ Labs Company:** This represents the tokens owned by the company to cover the development and operational expenses.

3\. **GGEZ Rewards Token Staking Pool:** pay staking rewards.
