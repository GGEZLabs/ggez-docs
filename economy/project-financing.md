# Project Financing

Investors interested in the project can participate by buying the GGEZ1 tokens. It is an investable vehicle with a volatile pricing valuation for investors to make potential gains in the future. The token Will have a **limited supply of 1,777,777,777.**

GGEZ1 project token price valuation used is based on the **Net Present Value (NPV)** of the project taking into consideration discounted cash flow estimates and required rates of return. Utilizing this technique, a token price range between **$0.02 USD** and **$0.03 USD** was determined; for early investors, a price of **$0.011 USD** has been determined to be the initial token sale price.

We will start building the GGEZ platform and economy through multiple phases of development, each phase announcement will come in the form of improvement proposals with a suggested release and sales of tokens from escrow that will be used to jumpstart the new phases and we will present a detailed plan of the new features and their estimated impact on the project.

We plan to start the project fundraising during the period Q3 2022; we will issue **1,777,777,777** **GGEZ1 governance tokens** and offer **5%** of the total token supply as a seed sale through private sales and an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) at a sale price of **$0.011**.
