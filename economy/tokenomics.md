# Tokenomics

This project has two token types: the **GGEZ rewards token** and the **GGEZ1 project token.**

The **GGEZ rewards token** is a utility token that the platform users use as a reward token; it is a **fungible asset token** that represents a portfolio of real-world assets, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and real estate; the GGEZ token reflects the **value of the backed assets**, providing the token owners with a **good investment**, **safe store of value**, and **protection against inflation**; the tokens can also be staked to generate yield; tokens get created as the circulation of the token grows, and there are no limits to the supply of the token.&#x20;

The **GGEZ1 project token** is a governance token where holders can participate in the platformâ€™s governance via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions regarding the GGEZ1 platform ecosystem and will have a limited supply of **1,777,777,777**.
