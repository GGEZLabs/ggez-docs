# Team Vision

The team combines experience building a financial platform and an EVD POS distribution platform to gain valuable insight into the merchant-consumer dynamic to realize a huge potential for a crypto rewards and loyalty platform in the region.

The team envisions a crypto rewards token that can be collected and redeemed across brands and countries, creating a consolidated loyalty network that is permissionless, transparent, password-less, and easy to use for both the consumer and the merchant; the GGEZ rewards token will increase consumers' engagement with merchants by increasing flexibility and cutting some of the restrictions that come with traditional reward programs.

The team wants to be the first in the region to do such an ambitious project; a rewards token to be used by over 30 countries in the Middle East and Africa with a population of over 1.5 billion with the aim to bring crypto into the mainstream by attracting first young online gaming enthusiasts and then the general public.
