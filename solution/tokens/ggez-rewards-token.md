It is a **collateralized asset** token backed by a portfolio of income-generating real-estate assets; the assets collateral consists of global **income-generating real-estate investment trusts (REITs)** across a range of property sectors in developed and emerging markets. The token allows anyone to easily invest in a portfolio of income-generating real estate assets without actually having to go out and buy, manage, or finance a property.

It is an **asset collateralized token** that is backed by a portfolio of real-world assets, the GGEZ token price reflects the value of the backed assets, offering token holders a good investment, safe store of value, and protection against inflation; the tokens can also be staked to generate yield.

* **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) REITs in developed markets, about 50% of the portfolio value**; ETFs are considered a liquid investment, and this will allow us to easily exchange the GGEZ token back to fiat currency or other crypto assets to pay back any requests to redeem the GGEZ Rewards tokens.
* **Direct REITs in emerging markets, about 50% of the portfolio value**; this will allow us to invest in long-term sustainable and green projects that will achieve better long-term ROI, have a positive economic & environmental impact, and help communities grow & thrive. These investments include Smart Farming & AgriTech, Renewable Energy, Green Transportation, Water Investments, and Waste Reduction.

Most people living in emerging markets consider real estate the best and safest way to invest, protect against inflation, and generate income. Historically, real estate has delivered competitive returns, steady dividend income, and long-term capital appreciation. Their comparatively low correlation with other assets makes them an excellent portfolio diversifier that can help reduce overall portfolio risk and increase returns.

**Stablecoin**

The tokens are non-interest bearing and designed to have stable value; stability is achieved by investing in stable REITs as collateral to back the obligation to redeem the outstanding asset token when required. There are no token supply limits as we will be issuing new tokens as the demand for the token grows.

**Price**

The token price reflects the value of the underlying reserve assets in USD; the token price will be around **0.01 USD**; however, as the value of the underlying assets appreciates, the token price will reflect the value increase. The value of the asset reserves will be published and updated periodically.

GGEZ token holders can request to exchange their tokens for USD anytime from the platform; the token value will be calculated based on the value of the underlying assets at the time of the request.
